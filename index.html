        My name is Christopher Sloggett. I am a licensed Captain with the US
        Coast Guard and also a Senior student at Portland State University,
        majoring in Computer Science. I am currently in the process of rebuilding
        the website SailScovare.com, and its really exciting! I have integrated 
        the booking system into my personal website so I can test the look and feel 
        of it on the new website I am creating, which is why you have been navigated 
        here if you clicked the back button while trying to make a booking. Shane knows
        me really well and vice versa, and if you book a cruise with Shane you will
        likely have me as your captain! Feel free to look around on this site, or continue
        with your booking below :)
