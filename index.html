        My name is Christopher Sloggett. I am a Senior student at Portland State
        University, majoring in Computer Science. Having been interested in web
        development for quite some time I am very excited to be a part of this
        class! In my off time, I enjoy suring, sailing, snowboarding,
        offroading, climbing, hiking, computers, and many many more things!
