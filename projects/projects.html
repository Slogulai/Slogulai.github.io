          This project is a collective effort between two other students and I.
          The premise of the project is a cat and mouse game, where one agent is
          chasing the other. The agent that is running away takes advantage of
          the A* search algorithm to run away, while the chasing agent is
          learning using Reinforcement Learning through a q table on how to
          catch the A* agent. The program runs through 1000 episode through 5
          different boards with an animation every 50 episodes to illustrate how
          the reinforcment learning agent does over the 1000 episode trial. My
          contribution to the project was the integration of the maze
          environment with the OpenAIGym framework and the implementation of the
          QLearning RL Class. The image of the human and zombie is a frame from
          when the program runs.

        <p>
          This project was my first forray into web development, and boy was it
          a tough one! The project was to build a web server exclusively in
          Rust. Given Rust's memory safe features, this is an excellent language
          for a web server and there are a number of frameworks to pick from.
          Axum was the framework of choice on this web server. The project
          involved using a docker container to store a sql database and serve
          that data to a web page. My understanding of HTML at the time of the
          submission was not vast, so the html ended up being very basic while I
          focused more on the back end throughout the project. This will be a
          project that I will update in the near future given my new knowledge
          of web development!
